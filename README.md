# AI Visualizer

This project is an AI visualization web application meant to assist in the teaching and learning of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithms.

Backed by [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [React](https://react.dev) with [next.js](https://nextjs.org)

## How to run the AI Visualizer

### Prerequisites:

You'll need to install some software before you can start using the AI visualizer locally.

- Python (recommended version: 3.11) with the pip package manager
- Node.js (recommended version: latest)

### First-time setup

You might need to do this again when we have module/dependency changes.

- In `/ai-visualizer`, run `npm i` - This will install all required node dependencies
- In `/api`, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` - This will install the Flask python package using pip, along with any other required dependencies.

### Launching the AI Visualizer

- In the `/ai-visualizer` subfolder, run `npm run dev`
- In the `/api` subfolder, run `py main.py` (The way you run python may vary slightly depending on your installation.)
